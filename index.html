        <h1 class="mt-4">Intro to Data Mesh</h1>
        <p>The concept of data mesh was first shared by Zhamak Dehghani of ThoughtWorks (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhamak-dehghani/">LinkedIn</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/zhamakd">Twitter</a>) as a reaction to seeing large customers spending far more on big data platforms but failing to see value from the investment. For her, centralized data infrastructure, especially things like a single data lake owned and managed by a specialized data infrastructure team, created complexity without value for most companies. Data producers (services) treating data as a by-product instead of a product.</p>
        <p>The high-level data mesh concept is organizational alignment around creating data products, where ownership of data products extends beyond getting data into a centralized data warehouse/lake, but through to actual consumption by analysts and data scientists. It aligns data engineering with data production from services AND data analysis.</p> 
        <p>Data mesh has 4 pillars:
        <p><b>Domain-oriented, decentralised data ownership and architecture</b> - no more data ownership by a data warehouse/lake team, give ownership to those who know the data best (domain driven design but for data) and can package it best for others.</p>
        <p><b>Creating data products with true data owners</b> - I feel this one is often phrased think of your data as a product but not all data should be productized. Data product owners need to have SLAs/SLOs/SLIs for their data products, just like any other product owner would.</p>
        <p><b>A self-service data infrastructure platform</b> for creating data products, serving data products to consumers, and consumption of data products - often referred to as the overall data platform consisting of one to many data nodes.</p>
        <p><b>Federated computational governance</b>, which is important but I feel should be left for last - basically, keep decision making as locally as possible but have some centralized control so everyone doesn't have to reinvent the data access security rules.</p>
        <p>Zhamak has been, for good reason, reticent to make default architectural recommendations. A data mesh needs a strong technological basis but organizational buy-in and structure is far more important than any one technology or product. If you do not have true data product ownership, no piece of software will make your data mesh drive the value you expect from it.</p>
        <p><b>Recommended first content:</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiUhV56uVUc">this presentation by Zalando and ThoughtWorks</a> that walks through the general data mesh concept and covers some clear issues Zalando (a large European fashion retailer) was having with their existing organizational/architectural setup, why they moved to a data mesh, and how they moved to a data mesh. Pacing is great.</p>
        <p>Recommended additional content:</p>
        <p>Zhamak's two articles, the initial <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html">introducing the data mesh concept</a> and the second <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html">expanding on the concept</a>. They are a little heavy on the brain so be prepared for a lot of very useful info. We recommend reading them slowly and taking a few notes on each section.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_-fHo0ZkAo">This 40min video</a> is a great introduction to the concept by Zhamak, taking you from unfamiliar to a solid understanding of how a data mesh implementation could work. It is paced well and isn't too much information overload.</p>
